ProjectGenerator is a simple tool for template-based file and directory tree generation.

Other software of this category is a [CodeSmith](http://www.ericjsmith.net/codesmith/), but it is not an open project and is too complex for such simple thing.

ProjectGenerator uses wonderful TemplateMachine code generator, and extend it's functionality to directory structure.

Moreover, ProjectGenerator supply the feature of saving/restoring _variables_ and caching for working in multiple-times usage mode. This helps maintain things like random project GUIDs and saved customisation.

ProjectGenerator have only command-line interface. All config and cache files are in plain text format.
